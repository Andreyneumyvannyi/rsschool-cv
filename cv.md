### About me

I have no experience in commercial development. I started studying with Python, and decided to develop Frontend on this basis. I am good at computer technology, I am engaged in the repair of electronics, in particular, laptops and mobile phones. I like to collect various configurations of system units and test individual nodes. I have been fascinated by technology and programming since childhood, I am always looking for a path of development, sitting still is not about me. I study on my own, I can work with information, Google is a faithful friend and helper. I prefer to read the documentation and consolidate my knowledge with practice.
